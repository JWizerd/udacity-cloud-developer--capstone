# Udacity - Capstone - Share Markets POC

## What is a Share Market?
A Share Market is a decentralized market where people can share or gift goods and services without the intervention of a centralized entity. Typically in a Share Market, there is no immediate or future rewards, nor do items have any value outside of the receiver's necessity or the agreed upon value of both parties in a given exchange. The rules of a share market are dictated by everyone involved in the event. Share Market rules can vary for each event. For instance, bartering systems can take place, people can set how much a receiver can have as to better distribute the sharing of goods across the gathering. The idea is based on a gift economy and also the anarchist inspired principle that people can organize and manage themselves without a centralized entity.


## What is a Gift Economy?
A gift economy or gift culture is a mode of exchange where valuables are not sold, but rather given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards.


## Why not just use Facebook Marketplace or Events?
Some people do not want to participate in social media platforms but still want to contribute and create their own share markets (i.e. anarchists, non-confirmers, religious folk etc.). Therefore a separate platform is much needed.


## What types of goods and services are typically sold at Share Markets?
Really anything that you want to get rid of! Excess vegetables from your garden, old computers, clothes, pretty much anything that you would donate. Keep in mind, giving away a gift that is gross, unsanitary, dangerous, toxic etc. is generally looked down upon.


## General code of conduct:
- Share items that are safe, of decent quality, aren't expired.
- Treat others as you would like to be treated.
- Take only what you need.
- Give only what you safely can
- Give only what belongs to you
- Keep it PG, there are typically children at these events
- Keep it legal, as much as we love to stick to the man, there's no reason to go to jail.
